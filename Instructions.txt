To do:
Test with sensor logger app ✅
- ngrok is a small networking tool that lets you share your
  local computer’s web server (like your FastAPI app) with
  the internet safely -> give this link to the sensorLogger app
- A tool that gives your local server a secure, public HTTPS address
- Lets your phone, teammates, or webhooks connect to your app while you’re developing locally
- Public URL → forwards requests → your local FastAPI app
